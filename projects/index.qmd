<h1>Projects</h1>

The following projects are the most recent self-directed projects I have completed.

[Mobile Data Exploratory Analysis](mobiledata.html) is an RShiny-based project that creates an interactive app for users to numerically and graphically explore a Mobile Behavior data set. App was created to fulfill project requirements for ST558, Data Science for Statisticians. The App has been ported from [The ShinyApps Website](https://rmferran.shinyapps.io/project_2_558/)

**Keywords:** Exploratory data analysis, ggplot, rshiny, mobile behavior, client-centered, interactive, download, subsetting, categorical analysis, numerical analysis, facet wrap


[Metal Concentration in Turtles](turtles.html) is an R-based project concerning the investigation of urbanization on freshwater turtles. My partner and I were offered (and accepted) co-authorship on the client's paper due to our statistical contributions.

**Keywords:** high-dimensional statistical modeling, lasso regression, Redundancy Analysis (RDA), Best subsets regression, rank analysis, exploratory data analysis, turtles, proxy, urbanization, metals


[Are Students Using the Right Criteria When Choosing Schools?](matric.html) is a [paper completed for ST704, Statistical Methods II](assets/paper.pdf). This paper uses multiple advanced statistical techniques to analyze complex data, such as Beta Regression, Quantile Regression, and Spatial Regression. Paper was crafted alongside professional presentation for ST704, Statistical Methods II.

**Keywords:** Beta regression, spatial modeling, spatial covariate, quantile regression, crime rate, university matriculation, college, pinball loss function, student, United States
