I play at the 3.5/4.0 NTRP level and consider myself an aggressive baseliner.\n🏃 I am a (newbie!) long-distance runner. Hoping to run some more half-marathons in 2025 and run a full marathon in 2026. I love to run in forested, shrubby environments where nature is aplenty!\n☀️️ I’m from Florida, specifically the Tampa/Orlando areas. Although the beach has my heart forever, I enjoy the moderate climate in the Carolinas and plan to reside here permanently. :)\n🗣️ I love public speaking - teaching was a lot of fun because it gave me an avenue to explore speaking to a large group regularly. When I present my research and ideas, I prefer the room to be large and the audience to be full.\n🎮 I tend to enjoy board games and video games, particularly the fast-paced competitive kind. Whatever allows me to coordinate with my friends and kick butt!"
