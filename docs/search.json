I play at the 3.5/4.0 NTRP level and consider myself an aggressive baseliner.\n🏃 I am a (newbie!) long-distance runner. Hoping to run some more half-marathons in 2025 and run a full marathon in 2026. I love to run in forested, shrubby environments where nature is aplenty!\n☀️️ I’m from Florida, specifically the Tampa/Orlando areas. Although the beach has my heart forever, I enjoy the moderate climate in the Carolinas and plan to reside here permanently. :)\n🗣️ I love public speaking - teaching was a lot of fun because it gave me an avenue to explore speaking to a large group regularly. When I present my research and ideas, I prefer the room to be large and the audience to be full.\n🎮 I tend to enjoy board games and video games, particularly the fast-paced competitive kind. Whatever allows me to coordinate with my friends and kick butt!"

I’m Robbie, a data professional with a Master’s in Statistics from NC State University, where I completed PhD-level core coursework in statistical methods and theory. With almost 5 years of relevant experience in data science, research, and statistician-based work, I specialize in delivering insights that empower data-driven strategies. I am proficient in R, SAS, JMP, CSS/HTML, Python, and more. This website is intended to present snippets of my work, as well as more information about who I am.\n\n\nThe quick links below can direct you to any page of interest on my website. :)\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\nProjects Work Experience Education Resume Interests Contact Me"

This app was created to complete the project requirements outlined in ST558, Data Science for Statisticians at North Carolina State University. Although a relatively simple app, I believe it is a showcase for my programming knowledge in R as well as my ability to make something client-centered.\nMetal Concentration in Turtles is a project that displays explorative data analysis, high-dimensional statistical modeling, and curated conclusion making. The real data has been censored for the privacy of the publisher, but my statistical contributions are still visible. This project was created in conjunction with ST542, Statistical Consulting at North Carolina State University. After a semester long research project working with the client and their data, I was offered (and accepted) co-authorship on the paper due to my statistical contributions."
