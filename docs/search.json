I play at the 3.5/4.0 NTRP level and consider myself an aggressive baseliner.\n🏃 I am a (newbie!) long-distance runner. Hoping to run some more half-marathons in 2025 and run a full marathon in 2026. I love to run in forested, shrubby environments where nature is aplenty!\n☀️️ I’m from Florida, specifically the Tampa/Orlando areas. Although the beach has my heart forever, I enjoy the moderate climate in the Carolinas and plan to reside here permanently. :)\n🗣️ I love public speaking - teaching was a lot of fun because it gave me an avenue to explore speaking to a large group regularly. I generally prefer a larger audience when presenting my research because it gets me in the zone.\n🎮 When not doing work, playing tennis, or running, I have a soft spot for video games and board games. I enjoy the collaborative kind and the fast-paced competitive kind."

    "text": "Crime Rate and Matriculation Rate\n\n\nProject Abstract:\n\n\nGiven the evidence that crime rates affect the learning ability of middle and high school students, this analysis focuses on trying to determine whether students across the US are using crime rates when picking a university or college to attend. Using a university’s matriculation rate as a response and crime rates as covariates, we fit a beta regression, first without and then accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Given the evidence that the impact of crime rates may vary for universities with different matriculation rates, we lastly fit a quantile regression to show that only a small range of universities are marginally affected by the area’s crime rate. This trend speaks to the apparent lack of student care in crime rates in the university’s town or city, and given the importance of local crime in learning, students should be made more aware of the importance of crime rates in the colleges they plan on attending.\n\nClick Here to View the Full Paper"
