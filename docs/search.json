I play at the 3.5/4.0 NTRP level and consider myself an aggressive baseliner.\n🏃 I am a (newbie!) long-distance runner. Hoping to run some more half-marathons in 2025 and run a full marathon in 2026. I love to run in forested, shrubby environments where nature is aplenty!\n☀️️ I’m from Florida, specifically the Tampa/Orlando areas. Although the beach has my heart forever, I enjoy the moderate climate in the Carolinas and plan to reside here permanently. :)\n🗣️ I love public speaking - teaching was a lot of fun because it gave me an avenue to explore speaking to a large group regularly. When I present my research and ideas, I prefer the room to be large and the audience to be full.\n🎮 I tend to enjoy board games and video games, particularly the fast-paced competitive kind. Whatever allows me to coordinate with my friends and kick butt!"

    "text": "Crime Rate and Matriculation Rate\n\n\nProject Abstract:\n\n\nGiven the evidence that crime rates affect the learning ability of middle and high school students, this analysis focuses on trying to determine whether students across the US are using crime rates when picking a university or college to attend. Using a university’s matriculation rate as a response and crime rates as covariates, we fit a beta regression, first without and then accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Given the evidence that the impact of crime rates may vary for universities with different matriculation rates, we lastly fit a quantile regression to show that only a small range of universities are marginally affected by the area’s crime rate. This trend speaks to the apparent lack of student care in crime rates in the university’s town or city, and given the importance of local crime in learning, students should be made more aware of the importance of crime rates in the colleges they plan on attending.\n\nClick Here to View the Full Paper"
