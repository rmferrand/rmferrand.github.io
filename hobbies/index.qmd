<h1> Hobbies and Interests </h1>
🎾 I'm an avid Tennis enjoyer. I play at the 3.5/4.0 NTRP level and consider myself an aggressive baseliner.

🏃 I am a (newbie!) long-distance runner. Hoping to run some more half-marathons in 2025 and run a full marathon in 2026. I love to run in forested, shrubby environments where nature is aplenty!

☀️️ I'm from Florida, specifically the Tampa/Orlando areas. Although the beach has my heart forever, I enjoy the moderate climate in the Carolinas and plan to reside here permanently. :)

🗣️ I love public speaking - teaching was a lot of fun because it gave me an avenue to explore speaking to a large group regularly. I generally prefer a larger audience when presenting my research because it gets me in the zone.

🎮 When not doing work, playing tennis, or running, I have a soft spot for video games and board games. I enjoy the collaborative kind and the fast-paced competitive kind.
